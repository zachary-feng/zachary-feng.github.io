# Hello, how is it going?

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wzcu3tAG1ugrM5PNs4VyZ-_pRUc00ehZ/view?usp=sharing).

Here are some things that I've written:
- [Class groups in the context of binary quadratic forms and number fields](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zMFsCFtF95_Zf2YLwfpoP4hVRuuz-Fdg/view?usp=sharing)
- The ideal class group and the unit group (coming soon!)
- [Solving the 4-by-4 Lights Out puzzle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pCQBEMuFNAUI60hEiKKjEv_DLU5RBGzM/view?usp=sharing)
- [A Latent Variable Model State Estimation System for Image Sequences](https://elib.dlr.de/127325/)

In my free time, I like to learn Japanese. I will be sitting the JLPT N3 exam this December!
